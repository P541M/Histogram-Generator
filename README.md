# Histogram Generator for Text Files
This is a C-based program that generates histograms for text files. Each child process reads a file, counts the frequency of each letter, and writes the histogram to a file. The project handles multiple files simultaneously and includes signal handling for process management.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/P541M/Histogram-Generator.git
cd Histogram-Generator
```

## Compiling/Execution
Any iteration can work for running the program, you can even add your own files!
```
make

./A1 test1.txt

./A1 test1.txt test2.txt

./A1 test1.txt SIG test2.txt
```
